# Project 02 â€“ Reusable VPC Module

**Objective:** Hands-on Infrastructure-as-Code project using **OpenTofu** on **AWS**, focusing on modular and reusable cloud network design.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment of a **flexible and reusable VPC module**, including:

* **VPC & Subnets:** Modular network setup allowing easy replication and customization
* **Internet Gateway & NAT Gateway:** Secure connectivity for public and private subnets
* **Route Tables:** Proper routing for internet-bound and internal traffic
* **Module Outputs:** Key IDs exposed for integration with other modules or resources

## Highlights

* Hands-on practice with **modular AWS networking using IaC**
* Promotes **consistency, reusability, and maintainability** across projects
* Infrastructure fully managed via **OpenTofu**

> This lab emphasizes clean module design, parameterization, and output management, providing a solid foundation for building scalable and advanced cloud architectures.
